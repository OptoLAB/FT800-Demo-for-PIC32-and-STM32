# FT800 Demo for PIC32 and STM32
 FT800 ConnectEVE demo for MINI MCU boards from Mikroelektronika
## About project

This is a demo project for [ConnectEVE](https://www.mikroe.com/connect-eve-board) display board with FT800 graphics controller by Mikroelektronika. Project contains source for custom built FT800 library ported on following [MINI MCU boards](https://www.mikroe.com/starter-boards/mini?silicon-vendor*=microchip,stm,microchip,stm) from [Mikroelektronika](https://www.mikroe.com/):

 - [MINI-32 for PIC32MX](https://www.mikroe.com/mini-32-for-pic32mz) small development board with PIC32MX534F064H by Mikroelektronika
 - [MINI-32 for PIC32MZ](https://www.mikroe.com/mini-32-for-pic32mz) small development board with PIC32MZ1024EFH064 by Mikroelektronika
 - [MINI-M0 for STM32](https://www.mikroe.com/mini-stm32f0) small development board with STM32F051R8 by Mikroelektronika
 - [MINI-M4 For STM32](https://www.mikroe.com/mini-stm32f4) small development board with STM32F415RG by Mikroelektronika

PIC32 demo projects are built using:
 
 - MPLAB X IDE (5.15) and XC32 (v2.15) by Microchip
 - mikroBootloader – Free and simple application by Mikroelektronika for programing MCU with a preloaded USB-HID bootloader.

STM32 demo projects are built using:

  - STM32CubeIDE (v1.3.0) and STM32CubeMX initialization code generator (v5.6.0) by STMicroelectronics.
  - (STM32M4) mikroBootloader (v2.8.0.0) - Free and simple application by Mikroelektronika for programing MCU with a preloaded USB-HID bootloader.
  - (STM32M0) Serial mikroBootloader (v2.2.0.0) - Free and simple application by Mikroelektronika for programing MCU with a preloaded Serial bootloader.


Demo project are tested using [OptoLAB mini development board](https://www.optolab.ftn.uns.ac.rs/index.php/education/project-base/281-simple-development-for-pic32-stm32-with-connecteve)
